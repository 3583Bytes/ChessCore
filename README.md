# About

This project is a product of a rather rash decision in mid 2008 to learn to program my own Chess Game, hence began my journey into the art of computer chess.  The main goal of the original project was to learn about how computers play chess while producing a chess engine that is easily understood and well documented.  I feel that goal has now been achieved.  As the next step I decided to release the full source code for my chess engine under the MIT license to allow other developers to learn and contribute to further improve & extend my chess engine.

The documentation & tutorial on how to build a chess engine can be accessed in the following 2 formats:
